--- abstract

An Entity Attestation Token (EAT) provides a signed (attested) set of
claims that describe state and characteristics of an entity, typically
a device like a phone or an IoT device.  These claims are used by a
relying party to determine how much it wishes to trust the entity.

An EAT is either a CWT or JWT with some attestation-oriented 
claims. To a large degree, all this document does is extend
CWT and JWT.

# Introduction

Remote device attestation is a fundamental service that allows a remote
device such as a mobile phone, an Internet-of-Things (IoT) device, or
other endpoint to prove itself to a relying party, a server or a
service.  This allows the relying party to know some characteristics
about the device and decide whether it trusts the device.

Remote attestation is a fundamental service that can underlie other
protocols and services that need to know about the trustworthiness of
the device before proceeding. One good example is biometric
authentication where the biometric matching is done on the device. The
relying party needs to know that the device is one that is known to do
biometric matching correctly.  Another example is content protection
where the relying party wants to know the device will protect the
data.  This generalizes on to corporate enterprises that might want to
know that a device is trustworthy before allowing corporate data to be
accessed by it.

The notion of attestation here is large and may include, but is not
limited to the following:

 * Proof of the make and model of the device hardware (HW)
 * Proof of the make and model of the device processor, particularly
   for security-oriented chips
 * Measurement of the software (SW) running on the device
 * Configuration and state of the device
 * Environmental characteristics of the device such as its GPS location

## CDDL, CWT and JWT

An EAT token is either a CWT as defined in {{RFC8392}} or a JWT as
defined in {{RFC7519}}. This specification defines additional claims
for entity attestation.

This specification uses CDDL, {{RFC8610}}, as the primary formalism to
define each claim.  The implementor then interprets the CDDL to come
to either the CBOR {{RFC7049}} or JSON {{ECMAScript}}
representation. In the case of JSON, Appendix E of {{RFC8610}} is
followed. Additional rules are given in {{jsoninterop}} of this
document where Appendix E is insufficient.  (Note that this is not to
define a general means to translate between CBOR and JSON, but only to
define enough such that the claims defined in this document can be
rendered unambiguously in JSON).

## Entity Overview

An "entity" can be any device or device subassembly ("submodule") that
can generate its own attestation in the form of an EAT.  The
attestation should be cryptographically verifiable by the EAT
consumer. An EAT at the device-level can be composed of several
submodule EAT's.  It is assumed that any entity that can create an EAT
does so by means of a dedicated root-of-trust (RoT).

Modern devices such as a mobile phone have many different execution
environments operating with different security levels. For example, it
is common for a mobile phone to have an “apps” environment that runs
an operating system (OS) that hosts a plethora of downloadable
apps. It may also have a TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) that is
distinct, isolated, and hosts security-oriented functionality like
biometric authentication. Additionally, it may have an eSE (embedded
Secure Element) - a high security chip with defenses against HW
attacks that can serve as a RoT.  This device attestation format
allows the attested data to be tagged at a security level from which
it originates.  In general, any discrete execution environment that
has an identifiable security level can be considered an entity.

## EAT Operating Models

At least the following three participants exist in all EAT operating
models. Some operating models have additional participants.
         
The Entity.
: This is the phone, the IoT device, the sensor, the sub-assembly or
such that the attestation provides information about.

The Manufacturer.
: The company that made the entity.  This may be a chip vendor, a
circuit board module vendor or a vendor of finished consumer products.

The Relying Party. 
: The server, service or company that makes use of the information in
the EAT about the entity.

In all operating models, the manufacturer provisions some secret
attestation key material (AKM) into the entity during manufacturing.
This might be during the manufacturer of a chip at a fabrication
facility (fab) or during final assembly of a consumer product or any
time in between. This attestation key material is used for signing
EATs.
 
In all operating models, hardware and/or software on the entity create
an EAT of the format described in this document. The EAT is always
signed by the attestation key material provisioned by the
manufacturer.

In all operating models, the relying party must end up knowing that
the signature on the EAT is valid and consistent with data from claims
in the EAT.  This can happen in many different ways. Here are some
examples.

* The EAT is transmitted to the relying party. The relying party gets
  corresponding key material (e.g. a root certificate) from the
  manufacturer. The relying party performs the verification.

* The EAT is transmitted to the relying party. The relying party
  transmits the EAT to a verification service offered by the
  manufacturer. The server returns the validated claims.
         
* The EAT is transmitted directly to a verification service, perhaps
  operated by the manufacturer or perhaps by another party. It
  verifies the EAT and makes the validated claims available to the
  relying party. It may even modify the claims in some way and re-sign
  the EAT (with a different signing key).

All these operating models are supported and there is no preference
of one over the other. It is important to support this variety of
operating models to generally facilitate deployment and to allow for
some special scenarios. One special scenario has a validation service
that is monetized, most likely by the manufacturer.  In another, a
privacy proxy service processes the EAT before it is transmitted to
the relying party. In yet another, symmetric key material is used for
signing. In this case the manufacturer should perform the
verification, because any release of the key material would enable a
participant other than the entity to create valid signed EATs.


## What is Not Standardized

The following is not standardized for EAT, just the same they are not
standardized for CWT or JWT.

### Transmission Protocol

EATs may be transmitted by any protocol the same as CWTs and JWTs. For
example, they might be added in extension fields of other protocols,
bundled into an HTTP header, or just transmitted as files. This
flexibility is intentional to allow broader adoption. This flexibility
is possible because EAT's are self-secured with signing (and possibly
additionally with encryption and anti-replay). The transmission
protocol is not required to fulfill any additional security
requirements.

For certain devices, a direct connection may not exist between the
EAT-producing device and the Relying Party. In such cases, the EAT
should be protected against malicious access. The use of COSE and JOSE
allows for signing and encryption of the EAT. Therefore, even if the
EAT is conveyed through intermediaries between the device and Relying
Party, such intermediaries cannot easily modify the EAT payload or
alter the signature.

### Signing Scheme

The term "signing scheme" is used to refer to the system that includes
end-end process of establishing signing attestation key material in
the entity, signing the EAT, and verifying it. This might involve key
IDs and X.509 certificate chains or something similar but
different. The term "signing algorithm" refers just to the algorithm
ID in the COSE signing structure. No particular signing algorithm or
signing scheme is required by this standard.

There are three main implementation issues driving this. First, secure
non-volatile storage space in the entity for the attestation key
material may be highly limited, perhaps to only a few hundred bits, on
some small IoT chips. Second, the factory cost of provisioning key
material in each chip or device may be high, with even millisecond
delays adding to the cost of a chip. Third, privacy-preserving signing
schemes like ECDAA (Elliptic Curve Direct Anonymous Attestation) are
complex and not suitable for all use cases.

Over time to faciliate interoperability, some signing schemes may be
defined in EAT profiles or other documents either in the IETF or outside.

# Terminology

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
"OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
BCP 14 {{RFC2119}} {{RFC8174}} when, and only when, they appear in all
capitals, as shown here.

This document reuses terminology from JWT {{RFC7519}}, COSE
{{RFC8152}}, and CWT {{RFC8392}}.

Claim Name.
: The human-readable name used to identify a claim.

Claim Key.
: The CBOR map key or JSON name used to identify a claim.

Claim Value.
: The CBOR map or JSON object value representing the value of the claim.

CWT Claims Set.
: The CBOR map or JSON object that contains the claims conveyed by the CWT or JWT.

Attestation Key Material (AKM).
: The key material used to sign the EAT token. If it is done
symmetrically with HMAC, then this is a simple symmetric key.
If it is done with ECC, such as an IEEE DevID {{IDevID}}, then this
is the private part of the EC key pair. If ECDAA 
is used, (e.g., as used by Enhanced Privacy ID, i.e. EPID) then it is the key material 
needed for ECDAA.


# The Claims Information Model

This section describes new claims defined for attestation. It also
mentions several claims defined by CWT and JWT are particularly
important for EAT.

Note also:
* Any claim defined for CWT or JWT may be used in an EAT including 
  those in the CWT {{IANA.CWT.Claims}} and JWT IANA {{IANA.JWT.Claims}}
  claims registries.
 * All claims are optional
 * No claims are mandatory
 * All claims that are not understood by implementations MUST be ignored

CDDL along with text descriptions is used to define the information
model.  Each claim is defined as a CDDL group (the group is a general
aggregation and type definition feature of CDDL). In the data model,
described in the {{datamodel}}, the CDDL groups turn into CBOR map
entries and JSON name/value pairs.

## Nonce Claim (cti and jti)

All EATs should have a nonce to prevent replay attacks. The nonce is
generated by the relying party, sent to the entity by any protocol,
and included in the token. Note that intrinsically by the nature of a
nonce no security is needed for its transport.

CWT defines the "cti" claim. JWT defines the "jti" claim. These carry
the nonce in an EAT.

TODO: what about the JWT claim "nonce"?

## Timestamp claim (iat)

The "iat" claim defined in CWT and JWT is used to indicate the
date-of-creation of the token.

## Universal Entity ID Claim (ueid)

UEID’s identify individual manufactured entities / devices such as a
mobile phone, a water meter, a Bluetooth speaker or a networked
security camera. It may identify the entire device or a submodule or
subsystem. It does not identify types, models or classes of
devices. It is akin to a serial number, though it does not have to be
sequential.

UEID’s must be universally and globally unique across manufacturers
and countries. UEIDs must also be unique across protocols and systems,
as tokens are intended to be embedded in many different protocols and
systems. No two products anywhere, even in completely different
industries made by two different manufacturers in two different
countries should have the same UEID (if they are not global and
universal in this way, then relying parties receiving them will have
to track other characteristics of the device to keep devices distinct
between manufacturers).

There are privacy considerations for UEID's. See {{ueidprivacyconsiderations}}.

The UEID should be permanent. It should never change for a given
device / entity. In addition, it should not be reprogrammable.  UEID’s
are variable length. All implementations MUST be able to receive
UEID's that are 33 bytes long (1 type byte and 256 bits).  The
recommended maximum sent is also 33 bytes.

When the entity constructs the UEID, the first byte is a type and the
following bytes the ID for that type. Several types are allowed to
accommodate different industries and different manufacturing processes
and to give options to avoid paying fees for certain types of
manufacturer registrations.

Creation of new types requires a Standards Action {{RFC8126}}.

| Type Byte | Type Name | Specification |
| 0x01 | RAND | This is a 128- to 256-bit random number generated once and stored in the device. This may be constructed by concatenating enough identifiers to be universally unique and then feeding the concatenation through a cryptographic hash function. It may also be a cryptographic quality random number generate once at the beginning of the life of the device and stored. It may not be smaller than 128 bits. |
| 0x02 | IEEE EUI | This makes use of the IEEE company identification registry. An EUI is made up of an OUI and OUI-36 or a CID, different registered company identifiers, and some unique per-device identifier. EUIs are often the same as or similar to MAC addresses. (Note that while devices with multiple network interfaces may have multiple MAC addresses, there is only one UEID for a device) TODO: normative references to IEEE.|
| 0x03 | IMEI | This is a 14-digit identifier consisting of an 8-digit Type Allocation Code and a 6-digit serial number allocated by the manufacturer, which SHALL be encoded as a binary integer over 48 bits. The IMEI value encoded SHALL NOT include Luhn checksum or SVN information.|
| 0x04 | EUI-48 | This is a 48-bit identifier formed by concatenating the 24-bit OUI with a 24-bit identifier assigned by the organisation that purchased the OUI. |
| 0x05 | EUI-60 | This is a 60-bit identifier formed by concatenating the 24-bit OUI with a 36-bit identifier assigned by the organisation that purchased the OUI. |
| 0x06 | EUI-64 | This is a 64-bit identifier formed by concatenating the 24-bit OUI with a 40-bit identifier assigned by the organisation that purchased the OUI. |
{: #ueid-types-table title="UEID Composition Types"}

UEID's are not designed for direct use by humans (e.g., printing on
the case of a device), so no textual representation is defined.

The consumer (the relying party) of a UEID MUST treat a UEID as a
completely opaque string of bytes and not make any use of its internal
structure. For example, they should not use the OUI part of a type
0x02 UEID to identify the manufacturer of the device. Instead they
should use the oemid claim that is defined elsewhere. The reasons for
this are:

* UEIDs types may vary freely from one manufacturer to the next.

* New types of UEIDs may be created. For example, a type 0x07 UEID may
  be created based on some other manufacturer registration scheme.

* Device manufacturers are allowed to change from one type of UEID to
  another anytime they want. For example, they may find they can
  optimize their manufacturing by switching from type 0x01 to type
  0x02 or vice versa.  The main requirement on the manufacturer is
  that UEIDs be universally unique. 
  
### CDDL
  
     ueid_claim = (
     ueid: bstr )
  
## Origination Claim (origination)

This claim describes the parts of the device or entity that are
creating the EAT. Often it will be tied back to the device or chip
manufacturer. The following table gives some examples:

| Name | Description |
| Acme-TEE | The EATs are generated in the TEE authored and configured by "Acme" |
| Acme-TPM | The EATs are generated in a TPM manufactured by "Acme" |
| Acme-Linux-Kernel | The EATs are generated in a Linux kernel configured and shipped by "Acme" |
| Acme-TA | The EATs are generated in a Trusted Application (TA) authored by "Acme"

TODO: consider a more structure approach where the name and the URI
and other are in separate fields.

TODO: This needs refinement. It is somewhat parallel to issuer claim
in CWT in that it describes the authority that created the token.

### CDDL

    origination_claim = (
    origination: string_or_uri )

## OEM identification by IEEE OUI (oemid)

This claim identifies a device OEM by the IEEE OUI. Reference TBD. It
is a byte string representing the OUI in binary form in network byte
order (TODO: confirm details).

Companies that have more than one IEEE OUI registered with IEEE should
pick one and prefer that for all their devices. 

Note that the OUI is in common use as a part of MAC Address. This
claim is only the first bits of the MAC address that identify the
manufacturer. The IEEE maintains a registry for these in which many
companies participate.

### CDDL

    oemid_claim = (
    oemid: bstr )


## The Security Level Claim (security_level)

EATs have a claim that roughly characterizes the device / entities 
ability to defend against attacks aimed at capturing the signing
key, forging claims and at forging EATs. This is done by roughly 
defining four security levels as described below. This is similar
to the security levels defined in the Metadata Service
defined by the Fast Identity Online (FIDO) Alliance (TODO: reference).

These claims describe security environment and countermeasures
available on the end-entity / client device where the attestation key
reside and the claims originate.

1 -- Unrestricted 
: There is some expectation that implementor will
protect the attestation signing keys at this level. Otherwise
the EAT provides no meaningful security assurances. 

2-- Restricted
: Entities at this level should not be general-purpose
operating environments that host features such as app download
systems, web browsers and complex productivity applications.
It is akin to the Secure Restricted level (see below) without the
security orientation. Examples include a Wi-Fi subsystem,
an IoT camera, or sensor device.

3 -- Secure Restricted
: Entities at this level must meet the criteria defined by FIDO Allowed
Restricted Operating Environments (TODO: reference). Examples include TEE's and 
schemes using virtualization-based security. Like the FIDO security goal,
security at this level is aimed at defending well against large-scale
network / remote attacks against the device.

4 -- Hardware
: Entities at this level must include substantial defense 
against physical or electrical attacks against the device itself.
It is assumed any potential attacker has captured the device and can 
disassemble it. Example include TPMs and Secure Elements.

This claim is not intended as a replacement for a proper end-device
security certification schemes such as those based on FIPS (TODO: reference)
or those based on Common Criteria (TODO: reference). The 
claim made here is solely a self-claim made by the Entity Originator.

### CDDL

    security_level_type = (
    unrestricted: 1,
    restricted: 2,
    secure_restricted: 3,
    hardware: 4
    )
    
    security_level_claim = (
    security_level: security_level_type )

## Secure Boot and Debug Enable State Claims (boot_state)

This claim is an array of five Boolean values indicating the boot and
debug state of the entity.

### Secure Boot Enabled

This indicates whether secure boot is enabled either for an entire
device or an individual submodule.  If it appears at the device level,
then this means that secure boot is enabled for all submodules.
Secure boot enablement allows a secure boot loader to authenticate
software running either in a device or a submodule prior allowing
execution.

### Debug Disabled

This indicates whether debug capabilities are disabled for an entity
(i.e. value of 'true').  Debug disablement is considered a
prerequisite before an entity is considered operational.

### Debug Disabled Since Boot

This claim indicates whether debug capabilities for the entity were
not disabled in any way since boot (i.e. value of 'true').

### Debug Permanent Disable

This claim indicates whether debug capabilities for the entity are
permanently disabled (i.e. value of 'true').  This value can be set to
'true' also if only the manufacturer is allowed to enabled debug, but
the end user is not.

### Debug Full Permanent Disable

This claim indicates whether debug capabilities for the entity are
permanently disabled (i.e. value of 'true').  This value can only be
set to 'true' if no party can enable debug capabilities for the
entity. Often this is implemented by blowing a fuse on a chip as fuses
cannot be restored once blown.

### CDDL

    boot_state_type = [
        secure_boot_enabled=> bool,
        debug_disabled=> bool,
        debug_disabled_since_boot=> bool,
        debug_permanent_disable=> bool,
        debug_full_permanent_disable=> bool
    ]
    
    boot_state_claim = (
    boot_state: boot_state_type
    )


## The Location Claim (location)

The location claim is a CBOR-formatted object that describes the
location of the device entity from which the attestation originates.
It is comprised of a map of additional sub claims that represent the
actual location coordinates (latitude, longitude and altitude).  The
location coordinate claims are consistent with the WGS84 coordinate
system {{WGS84}}.  In addition, a sub claim providing the estimated
accuracy of the location measurement is defined.

### CDDL

    location_type = {
        latitude => number,
        longitude => number,
        altitude => number,
        accuracy => number,
        altitude_accuracy => number,
        heading_claim => number,
        speed_claim => number
    }
    
    location_claim = (
    location: location_type )

## The Age Claim (age)

The "age" claim contains a value that represents the number of seconds
that have elapsed since the token was created, measurement was made,
or location was obtained.  Typical attestable values are sent as soon
as they are obtained.  However, in the case that such a value is
buffered and sent at a later time and a sufficiently accurate time
reference is unavailable for creation of a timestamp, then the age
claim is provided.

    age_claim = (
    age: uint)

## The Uptime Claim (uptime)

The "uptime" claim contains a value that represents the number of
seconds that have elapsed since the entity or submod was last booted.

### CDDL

    uptime_claim = (
    uptime: uint )

## Nested EATs, the EAT Claim (nested_eat)

It is allowed for one EAT to be embedded in another. This is for
complex devices that have more than one subsystem capable of
generating an EAT. Typically, one will be the device-wide EAT that is
low to medium security and another from a Secure Element or similar
that is high security.

The contents of the "eat" claim must be a fully signed, optionally
encrypted, EAT token.

### CDDL

    nested_eat_claim = (
    nested_eat: nested_eat_type)

A nested_eat_type is defined in words rather than CDDL. It is either a
full CWT or JWT including the COSE or JOSE signing.

## The Submods Claim (submods)

Some devices are complex, having many subsystems or submodules.  A
mobile phone is a good example. It may have several connectivity
submodules for communications (e.g., Wi-Fi and cellular). It may have
subsystems for low-power audio and video playback. It may have one or
more security-oriented subsystems like a TEE or a Secure Element.

The claims for each these can be grouped together in a submodule.

Specifically, the "submods" claim is an array. Each item in the array
is a CBOR map containing all the claims for a particular submodule.

The security level of the submod is assumed to be at the same level as
the main entity unless there is a security level claim in that
submodule indicating otherwise. The security level of a submodule can
never be higher (more secure) than the security level of the EAT it is
a part of.

### The submod_name Claim

Each submodule should have a submod_name claim that is descriptive
name. This name should be the CBOR txt type.

### CDDL

In the following a generic_claim_type is any CBOR map entry or JSON name/value pair. 

    submod_name_type = (
    submod_name: tstr )

    submods_type = [ * submod_claims ]
    
    submod_claims = {
        submod_name_type,
        * generic_claim_type
    }
    
    submods_claim = (
    submods: submod_type )

# Data Model {#datamodel}
This makes use of the types defined in  CDDL Appendix D, Standard Prelude.

## Common CDDL Types

    string_or_uri = #6.32(tstr) / tstr; See JSON section below for JSON encoding of string_or_uri
    
## CDDL for CWT-defined Claims

This section provides CDDL for the claims defined in CWT. It is
non-normative as {{RFC8392}} is the authoritative definition of these
claims.

    cwt_claim = (
        issuer_claim //
        subject_claim //
        audience_claim //
        expiration_claim //
        not_before_claim //
        issued_at_calim //
        cwt_id_claim
    )
    
    issuer_claim = (
    issuer: string_or_uri )

    subject_claim = (
    subject: string_or_uri )

    audience_claim = (
    audience: string_or_uri )

    expiration_claim = (
    expiration: time )

    not_before_claim = (
    not_before: time )

### CBOR Interoperability

Variations in the CBOR serializations supported in CBOR encoding and
decoding are allowed and suggests that CBOR-based protocols specify
how this variation is handled. This section specifies what formats
MUST be supported in order to achieve interoperability.

The assumption is that the entity is likely to be a constrained device
and relying party is likely to be a very capable server. The approach
taken is that the entity generating the token can use whatever
encoding it wants, specifically encodings that are easier to implement
such as indefinite lengths. The relying party receiving the token must
support decoding all encodings.

These rules cover all types used in the claims in this document. They
also are recommendations for additional claims.

Canonical CBOR encoding, Preferred Serialization and Deterministically
Encoded CBOR are explicitly NOT required as they would place an
unnecessary burden on the entity implementation, particularly if the
entity implementation is implemented in hardware.

* Integer Encoding (major type 0, 1) --
The entity may use any integer encoding allowed by CBOR. The server
MUST accept all integer encodings allowed by CBOR.

* String Encoding (major type 2 and 3) --
The entity can use any string encoding allowed by CBOR including
indefinite lengths. It may also encode the lengths of strings in any
way allowed by CBOR. The server must accept all string encodings.

* Major type 2, bstr, SHOULD be have tag 21 to indicate conversion to
  base64url in case that conversion is performed.

* Map and Array Encoding (major type 4 and 5) --
The entity can use any array or map encoding allowed by CBOR including
indefinite lengths. Sorting of map keys is not required. Duplicate map
keys are not allowed. The server must accept all array and map
encodings. The server may reject maps with duplicate map keys.

* Date and Time --
The entity should send dates as tag 1 encoded as 64-bit or 32-bit
integers. The entity may not send floating-point dates. The server
must support tag 1 epoch-based dates encoded as 64-bit or 32-bit
integers. The entity may send tag 0 dates, however tag 1 is preferred. 
The server must support tag 0 UTC dates.

* URIs --
URIs should be encoded as text strings and marked with tag 32.

* Floating Point --
The entity may use any floating-point encoding. The relying party must
support decoding of all types of floating-point.

* Other types --
Use of Other types like bignums, regular expressions and such, SHOULD
NOT be used. The server MAY support them but is not required to so
interoperability is not guaranteed.

# IANA Considerations

## Reuse of CBOR Web Token (CWT) Claims Registry

Claims defined for EAT are compatible with those of CWT
so the CWT Claims Registry is re used. No new IANA registry
is created. All EAT claims should be registered in the
CWT and JWT Claims Registries.

### Claims Registered by This Document

* Claim Name: UEID
* Claim Description: The Universal Entity ID
* JWT Claim Name: N/A
* Claim Key: 8
* Claim Value Type(s): byte string
* Change Controller: IESG
* Specification Document(s): __this document__

TODO: add the rest of the claims in here

# Privacy Considerations {#privacyconsiderations}

Certain EAT claims can be used to track the owner of an entity and
therefore, implementations should consider providing privacy-preserving
options dependent on the intended usage of the EAT.  Examples would
include suppression of location claims for EAT's provided to
unauthenticated consumers.

## UEID Privacy Considerations {#ueidprivacyconsiderations}

A UEID is usually not privacy-preserving. Any set of relying parties
that receives tokens that happen to be from a single device will be
able to know the tokens are all from the same device and be able to
track the device. Thus, in many usage situations ueid violates
governmental privacy regulation. In other usage situations UEID will
not be allowed for certain products like browsers that give privacy
for the end user.  it will often be the case that tokens will not have
a UEID for these reasons.

There are several strategies that can be used to still be able to put
UEID's in tokens:

* The device obtains explicit permission from the user of the device
to use the UEID. This may be through a prompt. It may also be through
a license agreement.  For example, agreements for some online banking
and brokerage services might already cover use of a UEID.

* The UEID is used only in a particular context or particular use
case. It is used only by one relying party.

* The device authenticates the relying party and generates a derived
UEID just for that particular relying party.  For example, the relying
party could prove their identity cryptographically to the device, then
the device generates a UEID just for that relying party by hashing a
proofed relying party ID with the main device UEID.

Note that some of these privacy preservation strategies result in multiple UEIDs
per device. Each UEID is used in a different context, use case or system 
on the device. However, from the view of the relying party, there is just
one UEID and it is still globally universal across manufacturers.

# Security Considerations {#securitycons}

TODO: Perhaps this can be the same as CWT / COSE, but not sure yet
because it involves so much entity / device security that 
those do not.

# UEID Design Rationale

## Collision Probability

This calculation is to determine the probability of a collision of
UEIDs given the total possible entity population and the number of
entities in a particular entity management database.

Three different sized databases are considered. The number of devices
per person roughly models non-personal devices such as traffic lights,
devices in stores they shop in, facilities they work in and so on,
even considering individual light bulbs. A device may have
individually attested subsystems, for example parts of a car or a
mobile phone. It is assumed that the largest database will have at
most 10% of the world's population of devices. Note that databases
that handle more than a trillion records exist today.

The trillion-record database size models an easy-to-imagine reality
over the next decades. The quadrillion-record database is roughly at
the limit of what is imaginable and should probably be accommodated.
The 100 quadrillion datadbase is highly speculative perhaps involving
nanorobots for every person, livestock animal and domesticated
bird. It is included to round out the analysis.

Note that the items counted here certainly do not have IP address and
are not individually connected to the network. They may be connected
to internal buses, via serial links, Bluetooth and so on.  This is
not the same problem as sizing IP addresses.

| People     | Devices / Person | Subsystems / Device | Database Portion | Database Size           |
|------------+------------------+------------------- -+------------------+-------------------------+
| 10 billion | 100              | 10                  | 10%              | trillion (10^12)        | 
| 10 billion | 100,000          | 10                  | 10%              | quadrillion (10^15)     | 
|100 billion | 1,000,000        | 10                  | 10%              | 100 quadrillion (10^17) | 


This is conceptually similar to the Birthday Problem where m is the
number of possible birthdays, always 365, and k is the number of
people. It is also conceptually similar to the Birthday Attack where
collisions of the output of hash functions are considered.

The proper formula for the collision calculation is

       p = 1 - e^{-k^2/(2n)}
    
       p   Collision Probability
       n   Total possible population
       k   Actual population

However, for the very large values involved here, this formula requires floating
point precision higher than commonly available in calculators and SW so this
simple approximation is used. See {{BirthdayAttack}}. 

        p = k^2 / 2n 

For this calculation:
      
        p  Collision Probability
        n  Total population based on number of bits in UEID
        k  Population in a database

| Database Size           | 128-bit UEID | 192-bit UEID | 256-bit UEID |
|-------------------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+
| trillion (10^12)        | 2 * 10^-15   | 8 * 10^-35   | 5 * 10^-55   |
| quadrillion (10^15)     | 2 * 10^-09   | 8 * 10^-29   | 5 * 10^-49   |
| 100 quadrillion (10^17) | 2 * 10^-05   | 8 * 10^-25   | 5 * 10^-45   |

Next, to calculate the probability of a collision occurring in one year's 
operation of a database, it is assumed that the database size is in
a steady state and that 10% of the database changes per year. For example,
a trillion record database would have 100 billion states per year. Each
of those states has the above calculated probability of a collision.

This assumption is a worst-case since it assumes that each
state of the database is completely independent from the previous state.
In reality this is unlikely as state changes will be the addition or
deletion of a few records.

The following tables gives the time interval until there is a probability of 
a collision based on there being one tenth the number of states per year
as the number of records in the database.
   
      t = 1 / ((k / 10) * p)
  
      t  Time until a collision
      p  Collision probability for UEID size
      k  Database size

| Database Size           | 128-bit UEID   | 192-bit UEID | 256-bit UEID |
|-------------------------+----------------+--------------+--------------+
| trillion (10^12)        | 60,000 years   | 10^24 years  | 10^44 years  |
| quadrillion (10^15)     | 8 seconds      | 10^14 years  | 10^34 years  |
| 100 quadrillion (10^17) | 8 microseconds | 10^11 years  | 10^31 years  |

Clearly, 128 bits is enough for the near future thus the requirement that UEIDs
be a minimum of 128 bits.

There is no requirement for 256 bits today as quadrillion-record databases
are not expected in the near future and because this time-to-collision
calculation is a very worst case.  A future update of the standard may
increase the requirement to 256 bits, so there is a requirement that
implementations be able to receive 256-bit UEIDs.

## No Use of UUID

A UEID is not a UUID {{RFC4122}} by conscious choice for the following
reasons.

UUIDs are limited to 128 bits which may not be enough for some future
use cases.

Today, cryptographic-quality random numbers are available from common
CPUs and hardware. This hardware was introduced between 2010 and 2015.
Operating systems and cryptographic libraries give access to this 
hardware. Consequently, there is little need for implementations
to construct such random values from multiple sources on their own.

Version 4 UUIDs do allow for use of such cryptographic-quality 
random numbers, but do so by mapping into the overall UUID 
structure of time and clock values. This structure is of no
value here yet adds complexity. It also slightly reduces the
number of actual bits with entropy.

UUIDs seem to have been designed for scenarios where the implementor
does not have full control over the environment and uniqueness has to
be constructed from identifiers at hand. UEID takes the view that
hardware, software and/or manufacturing process directly implement
UEID in a simple and direct way. It takes the view that cryptographic
quality random number generators are readily available as they are
implemented in commonly used CPU hardware.
